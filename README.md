# MakeYourOwnCard
Lesson 4 Mini Project for Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics

This is my first project on GitHub.
It is a simple android app, which is actually a business card for a temporary home for dogs but it can be used as a template for any business card.

Main features:
1) Changing of the main image after clicking 'Next' button,
2) Expanding/collapsing information container.
